      "The jaguar is found throughout most of Brazil, but its population is highly endangered.",
    description: `The jaguar, the largest feline in the Americas, is on the list of endangered species in the vulnerable category. This is a species that can be found in different Brazilian biomes, but it is considered a symbol of the Pantanal.

    It is difficult to estimate the population in the Amazon and Pantanal, but in the Atlantic Forest and Caatinga the species is threatened.

    The main causes that threaten the extinction of the jaguar are related to hunting. In addition, deforestation also reduces its habitat and compromises the conservation of the species.

    Currently, it is estimated that its population does not exceed 10,000 individuals.`,

    description: `The maned wolf is an animal that is on the list of animals at vulnerable risk of extinction and its habitat is the Cerrado and Pampa biomes, in the latter the situation is more serious.

    The most common cause for the reduction of this species is related to the deforestation of vegetation.

    It is estimated that, in the Pampas, there is currently an average population of only 50 specimens.`,

      "Giant panda populations are increasing as a result of good conservation projects for the species.",
    description: `Giant pandas live in south-central China. There are 2,500 individuals living in isolated spots, creating obstacles for the animals to mate and collect food.

        The difficulty in promoting panda reproduction is enormous, as females only come into heat once a year for a maximum of three days.
        
        In 2005, in captive breeding projects, the species reproduced 25 young.`,

      "The fin whale is an endangered species classified as vulnerable",
    description: `The fin whale is the second largest whale species, measuring about 27 meters in length and weighing an average of 70 tons.

    This species of whale was once considered "endangered", but the ban on commercial hunting in the Pacific Ocean and in the southern hemisphere contributed to the increase in the population.
    
    Environmentalists and organizations claim that conservation campaigns for the species must be maintained in order to preserve the species.`,
